First load the java parser and driver in your work environment. The necessary 
JSON and mysql jar libraries are provided as well in the lib folder.

Change the username, host and password to match your current MYSQL's credentials in the 
parser.java.

Run the table SQL commands as mentioned in the file Table_Code.txt to get the proper 
relational db structure.

Load the sample JSON files as provided in the Subset JSON files folder. Once these files
are loaded in the environment run the driver.java file. It should parse through the data
to load them in your respective mysql.

Once loaded you should notice a structure in your respective DB manager. The screenshot 
of ours is provided in the screenshot folder.

After that you can run the provided R codes to see the same outputs as the one mentioned
in our document. A sample csv has been provided as well that has a joined table that we 
used for our most latest analysis.
